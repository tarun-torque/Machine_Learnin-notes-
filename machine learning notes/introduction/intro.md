AI vs ML vs DL 
1) AI - Ai is a branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart and intelligent machines.

2) ML is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed

3) Deep learning is a subfield of Machine learning that uses Artificial neural networks to learn from the data

<strong>There are three types of ML</strong>
1) Supervised
2) Unsupervised
3) Reinforcement

<strong>Supervised</strong> : In supervised learning algorithm the machine leaning algorithm learns from the labelled data.

<strong>Unsupervised</strong> : In unsupervised learning algorithm , th e machine learning algorithm learns from the unlabelled data.

<strong>Reinforcement</strong> : It is a area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment to maximize its rewards.




<h1> Types of supervised learning </h1>
1. Classification - Classification is about predicting a class or discreate values Eg.mala,female,true,false.
Algorithms :
1. Decision Tree classification
2. Random Forest Classification
3. K-nearest Neighbor

2. Regression - Regression is about predicting a quantity or continuous values Eg.Salary,age,price,amount of rain fall.
Algorithms : 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Support Vector Machines


<h1>Types of Unsupervised learning</h1>
1. Clustering : Clustering is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points
Algorithms : 
1. K-mean clustering
2. Hirarchical clustering
3. Principal Component Analysis(PCA)


2. Association : Association is an unsupervised task that is used to find important relationship between data points.
Algorithms: 
1. Apriori
2. Eclat
